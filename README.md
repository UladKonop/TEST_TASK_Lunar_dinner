# lunar_dinner

 Imagine we are organizing a Lunar dinner. 30 people have confirmed that they will come. We will all be seating at five 6-person tables (A, B, C, D, E, respectively). There will be 3 courses. After each course we'll change our seats. We'd like every person to sit with as many different people as possible throughout the dinner. As a bonus you may think of future similar occasions where different number of people and tables may be available.

Write a program that would assign 30 people to their seats (A1, A2, A3, etc., up to E6) during each course with that goal in mind. As a bonus you may think of future similar occasions where different number of people and tables may be available.
